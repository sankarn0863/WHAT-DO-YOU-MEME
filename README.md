My Ambition is to be a potential full stack developer, I’m not so experienced in this area but I have taken this subject out of passion, I’m ready to work hard for my most loved subject.


After my first class in this subject, I realized that I’m so fortunate to have a professor who is willing to help us not just in the Class hours but also off the Campus.


Thank you, Professor for the concern you have shown.
